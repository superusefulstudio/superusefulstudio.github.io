            <h3 class="title">Context</h3>
            <p>KGB Deals was one of the biggest daily deal sites around, providing offers and discounts for almost anything since 2010. They&apos;re owned by the New York-based KGB.
            They offer local deals in cities all across the UK, including London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff, and Belfast, meaning that wherever you are you should be able to track down a KGB deal nearby. They also have specific sections for travel deals and shopping deals, so it’s even easier to find the offers that you’re looking for.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="title">My role</h3>
            <p>I was brought on board to help with the website redesign and rebuild. Part of the new product strategy was to also incorporate ecommerce capabilities into the new version of the platform. A relatively straight forward project that I enjoyed working on including the team that I also worked with.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="title">Project rationale</h3>
            <p>The following product opportunities and limitations where identified by the product team:
                
                <div class="signpost">

                                <span>Around <strong>30% of users</strong> would purchase another deal or offer during the same session or within a 48 hour period</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Supplier/vendor feedback identified that there experience for users was broken as the user had to chase the vendor post purchasing an offer in order to book in a date to take the trip.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span><strong>75% of users are female.</strong> Focus groups informed us that the existing platform <strong>feels too masculine</strong>. However we need to retain the brand look and feel but give it a softer experience.</span>

            <p>An ambitious set of challenges and tasks lay ahead of the team to deliver a completely new platform. Our challenges covered:

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="title">Existing UI</h3>
            <p>A rather dated website design and format as I am sure you will agree. The orange was added by the marketing team as they believed that the bright bold colour would have more of an impact to users. The brand and marketing team wanted to retain the blue colour theme as this was baked into the core branding and communications languages. As a team we did however have <strong>carte blance</strong> to redesign everything else. We also won the argument to change the font stack to something better.
